# Neural network parameters
**Input** (1 = yes, -1 = no):
  * is top available to move
  * is right available to move
  * is bottom available to move
  * is left available to move
  * is food above snake
  * is food to the right of snake
  * is food under snake
  * is food to the left of snake

**Output** ([-1, 1]):
  * move top
  * move right
  * move down
  * move left

# Used libraries:
  * **AForge**: neural networks stuff
